\title{Check dimensionality}
\usage{
check_dimensionality(object, desired_units, variable_name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of which to check dimensionality}

\item{desired_units}{Required dimensionality, given as units (e.g., "ft/s")}

\item{variable_name}{Optional name of the object, for error reporting}
}
\value{
As of right now, nothing is returned
}
\description{
Internal function to check the dimensionality (i.e., units) of an object.
First, check that the object is a units object. Second, try to convert the
object to `desired_units` to ensure dimensionality is correct.
}
\details{
Check dimensionality of object
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
object <- set_units(1, "ft")
desired_units <- "m"
check_dimensionality(object, "m") # passes

# error because object has wrong dimensionality
check_dimensionality(object, "m^2", "object")
check_dimensionality(object, "m^2") # error, note difference in error reporting

check_dimensionality(1, "m", "object") # error because object not a units object
}
}
